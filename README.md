# Range adaptors in C++
This project is way for me to familiarize myself with the iterator and ranges libraries in C++.

## Task list
- [ ] Implement a transform_iterator
- [ ] Implement a transform range adaptor
- [ ] Implement a filter_iterator
- [ ] Implement a filter range adaptor
- [ ] Implement a zip adaptor that takes 2 ranges and returns a view on pairs of objects coming from these 2 ranges, then use it with the transform range adaptor
- [ ] Generalise the zip adaptor by letting it take any number of ranges
- [ ] Implement a [Cartesian product range adaptor](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/04/14/understand-ranges-better-with-the-new-cartesian-product-adaptor/)
- [ ] Implement your own new range adaptor
